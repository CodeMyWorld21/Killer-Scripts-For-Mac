# Run the Script at your own risk
This script deletes the log file completely, I have tested this on a virtual machine, and the firewall creates another. 
This may be true depemdimg on mac version

### Run the Script
it is recomended to run the script in order of choices to make a correct decision
```bash
sh MFLM.sh
```
check the log first, then delete the log.
I am not responsible for the deletion of the file, due to you choosing such choice.

### Enjoy
The empting of the script means more space!!!
